            "text": "Intro to Islandora CLAW\n\n\nIslandora CLAW is the project name for development of Islandora to work with Fedora 4. To fully understand Islandora CLAW, it is best to start by looking at its contrasts to the previous version of Islandora, known as 7.x-1.x.\n\n\nIslandora 7.x-1.x works as a bridge between Drupal 7.x and Fedora 3. Put simply, Islandora 7.x-1.x is middleware between Fedora 3 and Drupal 7.x, sometimes expressed as a hamburger:\n\n\nIslandora 7.x-1.x (with Fedora 3)\n\n\n\n\nIslandora CLAW does more than simply replace that base layer with Fedora 4. It is a total re-architecting of the interaction between the various pieces. Rather than a hamburger, Islandora CLAW is a chimera:\n\n\nIslandora CLAW (with Fedora 4)\n\n\n\n\nOr, for a diagram that doesn't involve food or animals:\n\n\n\n\nThis new structure has several advantages:\n\n\n\n\nParcelling out the various services and dependencies allows for more horizontal scalability\n\n\nChanging the relationship between Drupal and Fedora allows for a more flexible approach to front-end management (i.e, it need not be Drupal) while also taking much greater advantage of features available from Drupal (i.e, Fedora objects are treated more like nodes, for the purposes of using Drupal contrib modules. Many Islandora 7.x-1.x modules are redundant in Islandora CLAW because they reproduce existing Drupal contrib modules that can be used out of the box in Islandora CLAW).\n\n\nEasier to keep up-to-date as not all pieces must be versioned together.\n\n\nInstallations tools (Ansible, Docker, Vagrant) can automate uniting the pieces in a simple, clean installation process. Islandora has always been a turn-key repository solution, in the sense that it needs no customization once installed. With Islandora CLAW, that installation process is much smoother, with automated solutions that can be used in production.\n\n\n\n\nEcosystem\n\n\nAlpaca\n\n\nThe plumbing for Islandora's asynchronous workflows.

Work is underway to have this as a project on \ndrupal.org\n.\n\n\nWhy Switch?\n\n\nIslandora 7.x-1.x is a tried and tested product with a vibrant user and contributor community and many tools and add-ons available to customize and expand its uses. Islandora CLAW is a major departure, representing a great deal of work both in development of the software, and to migrate and upgrade existing Islandora sites. So why make the change?\n\n\nFedora\n\n\nThe primary motive for moving to Islandora CLAW is to stay current with the repository layer of our ecosystem. Moving to Fedora 4 is vital for the long-term utility of the project.\n\n\n\n\nFedora 3 is End-of-Life and has not been supported since 2015. This means that there will be no improvements, bug fixes, or security patches released for the software, drastically increasing individual maintenance needs for adopters.\n\n\nFedora 3 experiences significant slowdown when repositories reach a large (millions) number of objects. Fedora 4 is much more scalable, and is specifically engineered to be horizontally scalable in ways that Fedora 3 cannot.\n\n\n\n\nDrupal\n\n\nDrupal 8\n has been officially released and development has begun on Drupal 9. Official Drupal policy will see Drupal 7 become unsupported when Drupal 9 is released, putting it in the same precarious territory as Fedora 3.\n\n\nThe initial phases of Islandora CLAW development worked with Drupal 7 as a front-end, but Islandora CLAW has been architected with a pivot to Drupal 8 in mind from its very inception. As of June, 2016, Islandora CLAW development has pivoted fully to Drupal 8, ensuring that when the Islandora Community is ready to make the move, there will be a version of Islandora that functions with the latest and best-supported versions of both our front-end and repository layers by pairing Drupal 8 with Fedora 4.\n\n\nCommunity-Driven Design\n\n\nThe Islandora community has grown significantly since the project began, both in terms of users and contributors. For the first time, we are in a position to have a truly community-driven development process, in which any Islandora user can participate at whatever level fits their interests and abilities. Islandora CLAW has worked with the broader Islandora community to solicit use-cases, put forward prospectuses and project plans for review and editing, and has been developed with a mix of funding from Islandora Foundation members and volunteer developers working on sprints.\n\n\nIslandora CLAW is developed \nby\n the Islandora community, \nfor\n the Islandora community. As a member of the Islandora community, you can help to steer the direction it takes.\n\n\nLinked Data\n\n\nLinked Data is a big concept. A \ndefinition by Tim Bernes-Lee\n from 2006 articulates the basic idea in the context of the \"Semantic Web\":\n\n\n\n\nIt is about making links, so that a person or machine can explore the web of data. With linked data, when you have some of it, you can find other, related, data.\n\n\nLike the web of hypertext, the web of data is constructed with documents on the web. However, unlike the web of hypertext, where links are relationships anchors in hypertext documents written in HTML, for data they links between arbitrary things described by RDF. The URIs identify any kind of object or concept. But for HTML or RDF, the same expectations apply to make the web grow:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse URIs as names for things\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse HTTP URIs so that people can look up those names.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen someone looks up a URI, provide useful information, using the standards (RDF*, SPARQL)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInclude links to other URIs. so that they can discover more things.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLDP is an official W3C recommendation. According to \nthe spec\n, Linked Data Platform (LDP) defines a set of rules for HTTP operations on web resources, some based on RDF, to provide an architecture for read-write Linked Data on the web. Put more simply: An LDP server is a web server that lets you manage relationships in RDF by creating URLs you can perform CRUD (Create Read Update Delete) operation on:\n\n\n\n\nhttp://my_url/some_resource\n\n\nhttp://my_url/some_resource/children\n\n\nhttp://my_url/some_resource/children/child_resource\n\n\n prefix:isChildOf \nhttp://my_url/some_resource\n\n\n\n\nAn LDP server also lets you request the RDF graph for a resource with varying levels of additional information for discovery:\n\n\n\n\nThe resource itself\n\n\nThe resource plus child resources\n\n\nThe resource plus all other resources that reference it (inbound references)\n\n\nThe resource plus children plus inbound references\n\n\n\n\nFedora 4 is an LDP implementation. It stores metadata using RDF (Resource Description Framework), a standard format for data interchange on the web. RDF data is formatted as triples, like so: \nresource_uri\n \npredicate_uri\n \nobject_uri\n and can be exported in many different formats:\n\n\n\n\nJSON-LD\n\n\nRDF/XML\n\n\nTurtle\n\n\nN-Triples\n\n\n\n\nWorking with RDF is not entirely new in the Islandora/Fedora context, as RELS-EXT and RELS-INT have always been RDF/XML. Related objects can be included in RDF, so it functions as a graph you can traverse in order to discover more information.\n\n\nExample: Dublin Core as XML and RDF using the dc namespace\n\n\nDublin Core XML you store with the resource.\n\n\n?xml version=\n1.0\n?\n\n\nmetadata\n  xmlns=\nhttp://example.org/myapp/\n\n  xmlns:xsi=\nhttp://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\n\n  xsi:schemaLocation=\nhttp://example.org/myapp/ http://example.org/myapp/schema.xsd\n\n  xmlns:dc=\nhttp://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\n\n  \ndc:title\n\n    Islandora\n  \n/dc:title\n\n  \ndc:description\n\n    Islandora is an open-source software framework designed to help institutions and organizations and their audiences collaboratively manage, and discover digital assets using a best-practices framework.\n  \n/dc:description\n\n\n/metadata\n\n\n\n\n\nvs RDF (which is actually properties of the resource)\n\n\n@prefix dc: \nhttp://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\n .\n\nhttp://islandora.ca/\n dc:title \nIslandora\n ;\n   dc:description \nIslandora is an open-source software framework designed to help institutions and organizations and their audiences collaboratively manage, and discover digital assets using a best-practices framework.\n .\n\n\n\n\nInteroperability\n\n\nIslandora CLAW works with the \nPortland Common Data Model\n, \"a flexible, extensible domain model that is intended to underlie a wide array of repository and DAMS applications.\" What does this mean in practice? Objects stored in Islandora CLAW will have a data model that can be recognized by Hydra and other custom Fedora 4 based repository heads, and vice versa. By working together with the Hydra and Fedora communities, we can leverage a broader community of developers, librarians, and other digital repository users to build better tools and share resources.",

Non-RDF Source : Roughly equivalent to a datastream. A Non-RDF Source (or binary) is simply a bitstream (e.g. JPG, PDF, XML, MP3, etc.).",

            "text": "Islandora CLAW MVP\n\n\nMotivation\n\n\nThe Islandora CLAW project is currently transitioning from a prototype into a competitive product, and has had a requirements change from integration with Drupal 7 to Drupal 8. In order to aid in that transition, we are defining the minimum viable product. This will defend against scope creep, give clearly defined goals for community members to work towards, and present the point at which the CLAW team feels the software is ready to be tested out in small installations.\n\n\nNeedless to say, since this is a minimum product, a lot of parts of the previous prototype are either going to get replaced by an existing project to ease the maintenance load, or be removed altogether until time and resources allow other development.\n\n\nHigh Level Features\n\n\nThese are what are considered the minimum requirements for a functional Islandora CLAW that is worthy of a 1.0.0 release.\n\n\n\n\nContent modeled in Drupal as Entities using \nPCDM\n 1.0\n\n\nREST\n API exposed for Drupal Entities\n\n\nSupport for collections, images, books, and pages\n\n\nThe ability to control metadata mappings between Drupal and \nRDF\n\n\nProvide RDF based default descriptive metadata profile in Drupal\n\n\nThe ability to export/import \nJSON-LD\n\n\nAutomatic backup of Drupal content in Fedora 4\n\n\nAbility to restore/bootstrap a Drupal site from a properly structured Fedora 4 repository\n\n\nThe ability to index and search resources with Apache Solr\n\n\nThe ability to restrict access to collections and/or individual resources across all representations (Drupal, Fedora, Solr, etc\u2026)\n\n\nAsynchronous derivative generation\n\n\nVagrant\n environment for development purposes, which will serve as a starting point for more complicated, distributed installs\n\n\n\n\nArchitecture\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nIslandora is composed of four broad categories of technologies. On one end, there is the administrative interface, which users and other clients will interact with. On the other is a repository, which will hold binary data and RDF triples. In between the two are connectors, which are small pieces of software that react to events from either administrative interface or the repository. These connectors will utilize microservices -- small utilities exposed as web services either internally or out on the internet at large.\n\n\n\n\nAdministrative Interface\n\n\nDrupal 8\n\n\nDrupal 8\n provides a content management system (CMS for short) that allows end users the ability to create, edit, publish, and present digital content. Clients will interact with Drupal 8 via a browser or through a http client (such as \ncURL\n) in order to manipulate digital content. With each write operation, messages will be emitted to an event stream for processing by connectors.\n\n\nSQL DB\n\n\nDrupal 8 requires a \nMySQL\n (or drop-in replacement) or \nPostgres\n database.\n\n\nSearch Engine\n\n\nExisting Drupal 8 modules for \nApache Solr\n or \nElastic Search\n will be utilized to provide full text search.\n\n\nMicroservices\n\n\nA microservice is a small web service with functionality related to a single problem, even if it exposes just a single function. It can be deployed and configured independently of any other service, even having its own database if necessary. It can even be something that we don\u2019t directly maintain or control ourselves.\n\n\nID Mapping Service\n\n\nIdentifiers between Fedora and Drupal need to be aligned so we can trace our way from one end of the system to the other.  Implementing it as a microservice decouples this functionality from the rest of the codebase, allowing it to change or be pluggable with different mapping functions. It will utilize its own database. The ID indexing connector will be its primary client, updating the registry of IDs in response to repository events.\n\n\nImage Conversion Service\n\n\nImage conversion is a common operation in a content repository. Thumbnails, lower resolution copies for everyday access, and JP2s for use with IIIF image servers need to be generated when preservation masters are added or updated. This can be easily implemented by exposing ImageMagick\u2019s convert command as a microservice.\n\n\nText Extraction Service\n\n\nText extraction on PDFs or images of written text can be utilized to provide searching capabilities on content of a book or document.   Ghostscript can be used on text based PDF\u2019s. Images will require an OCR utility like \nTesseract\n.\n\n\nFITS Web Service\n\n\nThe \nFITS web service\n is an already existing project that extracts technical metadata and produces FITS xml files.\n\n\nRepository\n\n\nFedora\n\n\nFedora 4\n houses binary content along with RDF triples for metadata about repository content. It also conforms to the \nLDP\n specification, allowing for manipulation of relationships through HTTP operations.\n\n\nAPI-X\n\n\nAPI-X\n allows Islandora to extend the Fedora 4 API.  Microservices are registered in API-X and then \u2018bound\u2019 to repository content. A proxy sitting in front of Fedora exposes microservices as functions on repository content, which all HTTP requests must be routed through.  \n\n\nFor example, suppose Islandora is running the FITS web service described above.  Then let\u2019s say we \u2018bind\u2019 it to all binaries in Fedora, with an identifier of \u2018fits\u2019. If we have a binary file at \nhttp://fedora-host.com/fcrepo/rest/binaries/example\n, then instead of writing code to retreive the content and forward it to our FITS service, we simply visit the proxy at \nhttp://apix-host.com/fcrepo/rest/binaries/example/fits\n. \n\n\nSince services can be described, and that information is made available to interested clients, other applications can make informed decisions about what services are available for particular resources.\n\n\nTriplestore\n\n\nRDF content is indexed in a \nSPARQL\n 1.1 compliant triplestore.\n\n\nConnectors\n\n\nConnectors are small programs that listen to the event streams of either the Fedora repository or Drupal. In response to events, they perform actions, often bridging two pieces of technology together (like indexing a triplestore, hence \u2018connectors\u2019). \nApache Camel\n is a natural fit for these types of programs.\n\n\nConnectors will often delegate larger chunks of work to microservices, either bound to content through API-X or used stand-alone. They are primarily concerned with guaranteeing that events are responded to in a \nidempotent\n fashion.  Due to the nature of asynchronous messaging, certain guarantees, such as timeliness of delivery, cannot be made.  So connectors may need to retry a couple of times, or know to ignore a message that\u2019s delivered late or applied twice.  This is why it\u2019s important that operations are idempotent.\n\n\nID Indexer\n\n\nA connector will listen to Fedora events and index unique IDs contained in RDF using the ID Mapping microservice. The predicate used to notate unique IDs can be controlled through configuration. \n\n\nTriplestore Indexer\n\n\nA connector will listen to Fedora events and index RDF in a SPARQL 1.1 triplestore. This is provided by the Fedora community as part of the \nfcrepo-camel-toolbox\n project.\n\n\nSync\n\n\nA sub-project of \nAlpaca\n that provides two connectors for keeping information between Fedora and Drupal in sync. One, which indexes content in Fedora from Drupal events, is always running. The other, which indexes content in Drupal based on state in Fedora, is manually triggered through a re-indexing process like other fcrepo-camel-toolbox connectors.\n\n\nAlpaca\n\n\nAlpaca\n responds to creation and update events for binary files and creates derivative files based on the microservices it finds available for that type of binary in API-X. Derivatives are then ingested into Drupal, with Sync making sure they get flushed back to Fedora.\n\n\nRequest Flows\n\n\nHere are the proposed flows for all the different types of requests you can make against repository objects.\n\n\nRead a Resource\n\n\nSuppose a client views a resource in Islandora through their browser. A request is made to Drupal, which looks up the resource in an SQL database, and its representation is returned to the user.\n\n\n\n\nCreate a Resource\n\n\nSuppose a client submits a form to create a new Resource, or provides a json-ld or binary representation to an entity REST endpoint. The supplied representation is used to create an entity in Drupal. In response to the entity being saved, an event is emitted with supplied representation as the body. The response is then sent back to the client. If using a browser, the client should be redirected to the newly created resource.  \n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Sync will receive the creation event, and ingest the supplied representation in Fedora. Fedora will then emit a creation event.  \n\n\n\n\nThe ID Mapping connector will react, retrieving the Fedora representation and extracting an ID out of the RDF. That ID will be indexed in the ID Mapping microservice.\n\n\n\n\nThe triple store connector will also react, retrieving RDF and indexing it in the triple store.\n\n\n\n\nIf the node created was a preservation master, then Alpaca will respond by inspecting the list of derivative generation services bound as extensions on the preservation master in API-X. Each will be invoked, with the new resource getting ingested into Drupal.  \n\n\n\n\nThe process repeats itself again, with new events being emitted for the new entities getting created in Drupal. Sync responds and ingests the derivatives into Fedora.\n\n\n\n\nFedora emits the creation events, but since none are a preservation master, Alpaca does not respond and the cycle is broken.\n\n\n\n\nUpdate a Resource\n\n\nSuppose a client submits a form to update a new Resource, or provides a json-ld or binary representation to an entity REST endpoint.  In response to the entity being saved, an event is emitted with supplied representation as the body. The response is then sent back to the client.\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Sync will receive the update event, and apply it against the representation in Fedora. Fedora will then emit an update event.  \n\n\n\n\nThe triple store connector will also react, retrieving RDF and indexing it in the triple store.\n\n\n\n\nIf a binary of a presentation master was updated, then Alpaca will respond by inspecting the list of derivative generation services bound as extensions on the preservation master in API-X. Each will be invoked, with the new resource overwriting its predecessor in Drupal.\n\n\n\n\nThe process repeats itself again, with new events being emitted for the derivative entities getting updated in Drupal. Sync responds and ingests the derivatives into Fedora.\n\n\n\n\nFedora emits the creation events, but since none are a preservation master, Alpaca does not respond and the cycle is broken.\n\n\n\n\nDelete a Resource\n\n\nSuppose a client deletes a resource through the browser or API. In response to the entity being deleted, an event is emitted. The response is then sent back to the client.\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Sync will receive the delete event, and remove the corresponding resource in Fedora.\n\n\n\n\nThe ID Mapping connector will respond to the delete event by removing the resource\u2019s entry.\n\n\n\n\nThe triple store connector will also respond, deleting all triples with subject of the resource.\n\n\n\n\nContent Modeling in Fedora\n\n\nDescriptive metadata will be RDF properties, and a default dcterms descriptive metadata application profile will be created.\n\n\nTechnical metadata will be RDF properties, and follow the Hydra/Islandora led \ntechnical metadata application profile\n.\n\n\nHere are Turtle snippets representing the default collection, object, and file types.\n\n\nCollection\n\n\n  a pcdm:Collection   .\ndc:title \u201cCollection Title\u201d .\n    dc:description \u201cCollection description\u201d .\n    \u2026 other descriptive metadata \u2026\n\n\n\n\nImage\n\n\n  a pcdm:Object, schema:ImageObject .\n    pcdm:memberOf \nsomeCollection\n\n    dc:title \u201cImage Title\u201d .\n    dc:description \u201cImage description\u201d .\n    \u2026 other descriptive metadata \u2026\n\n\n\n\nImage Preservation Master File\n\n\n  a pcdmuse:PreservationMasterFile .\n    pcdm:fileOf \nsomeImage\n\n    ebucore:hasMimeType \u201cimage/jpeg\u201d\n    \u2026 other technical metadata \u2026\n\n\n\n\nImage Service File\n\n\n  a pcdmuse:ServiceFile .\n    pcdm:fileOf \nsomeImage\n\n    ebucore:hasMimeType \u201cimage/jpeg\u201d\n    \u2026 other technical metadata \u2026\n\n\n\n\nImage Thumbnail File\n\n\n  a pcdmuse:ThumbnailImage .\n    pcdm:fileOf \nsomeImage\n\n    ebucore:hasMimeType \u201cimage/png\u201d\n    \u2026 other technical metadata \u2026\n\n\n\n\nBook\n\n\n  a pcdm:Object, schema:Book .\n    pcdm:memberOf \nsomeCollection\n\niana:first \nfirstPageProxy\n\niana:last \nlastPageProxy\n\n    dc:title \u201cBook Title\u201d .\n    dc:description \u201cBook description\u201d .\n    \u2026 other descriptive metadata \u2026\n\n\n\n\nPage\n\n\n  a pcdm:Object, schema:ImageObject .\n    pcdm:memberOf \nsomeBook\n\n    dc:title \u201cPage Title\u201d .\n    dc:description \u201cPage description\u201d .\n    \u2026 other descriptive metadata \u2026\n\n\n\n\nPage Proxy\n\n\n  a ore:Proxy\n    ore:proxyFor \nsomePage\n\n    ore:proxyIn \nsomeBook\n\n    iana:prev \nprevPageProxy\n\n    iana:next \nnextPageProxy\n\n\n\n\n\nPage Preservation Master File\n\n\n  a pcdmuse:PreservationMasterFile .\n    pcdm:fileOf \nsomePage\n\n    ebucore:hasMimeType \u201cimage/tiff\u201d\n    \u2026 other technical metadata \u2026\n\n\n\n\nPage Intermediate File\n\n\n  a pcdmuse:IntermediateFile .\n    pcdm:fileOf \nsomePage\n\n    ebucore:hasMimeType \u201cimage/jp2\u201d\n    \u2026 other technical metadata \u2026\n\n\n\n\nPage Service File\n\n\n  a pcdmuse:ServiceFile .\n    pcdm:fileOf \nsomePage\n\n    ebucore:hasMimeType \u201cimage/jpeg\u201d\n    \u2026 other technical metadata \u2026\n\n\n\n\nPage Thumbnail File\n\n\n  a pcdmuse:ThumbnailImage .\n    pcdm:fileOf \nsomePage\n\n    ebucore:hasMimeType \u201cimage/png\u201d\n    \u2026 other technical metadata \u2026\n\n\n\n\nDrupal 8\n\n\nObjects will be modeled using \ncontent entities\n in Drupal 8. The content entities store their metadata as Drupal fields, which are mapped to RDF using an \nrdf mapping\n. An RDF mapping not only allows metadata to be transformed into json-ld, but it also controls which properties from Drupal get preserved in Fedora.\n\n\nFiles will be modeled using \nmedia entities\n. Media entities attempt to provide the base storage component for the Drupal 8. They can model any type of media, including local files, YouTube\nvideos, Tweets, Instagram photos, etc\u2026\n\n\nIngests and edits can be done for an entire graph of entities using \ninline entity forms\n. Although flushing back to Fedora happens at the per-Resource level, using inline entity forms makes the \nnamed graph\n the default unit of work for a repository architect.\n\n\nHere\u2019s an example of what an ingest form could look like using inline entity forms:\n\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s a list of the entities required to meet our goals. Each of these entities must have basic RESTful CRUD operations exposed for clients.\n\n\n\n\nRdfResource\n\n\nNonRdfResource\n\n\nProxy\n\n\nObject\n\n\nFile\n\n\nCollection\n\n\nImage\n\n\nPage\n\n\nBook\n\n\n\n\nIndividual entities and named graphs can be imported and exported in \njson-ld format\n using \njson-ld contexts\n.",

They are grouped together as features and deployed to Karaf container.\n\n\nOSGi\n\n\nOSGi is a specification to develop and deploy modular Java applications. It allows for dynamic deployment (hot deployment) and dependency management. \n\n\nThe base unit of resources is called a bundle. Bundle is similar to a jar file, with additional information to be processed as an OSGi component. Several bundles can be grouped together into a Feature and installed together. OSGi bundles can be run on containers implementing the OSGi specification. Apache Karaf is one such container\n\n\nKaraf\n\n\nApache Karaf is a container that can be used to deploy an array of applications such servlets, Apache Camel components, jars etc. \n\n\nKaraf - Bundle - Hello World\n\n\nDownload a bundle to the \nCLAW vagrant\n (ex to \n/home/ubuntu\n directory). An example hello world bundle is \nhere\n. \n\n\nIn Islandora CLAW vagrant, you can login to Karaf using ssh. The password is karaf. You can also use the client here: \n/opt/karaf/bin/client\n. Karaf client allows the use of linux commands such as \ngrep\n in addition to Karaf commands.  \n\n\nssh -p 8101 karaf@localhost\n\n\n\n\nInstall the bundle:\n\n\nkaraf@root()\n bundle\nkaraf@root(bundle)\n install file:///home/ubuntu/helloworld-1.0.0.jar\nBundle ID: 242\n\n\n\n\nThe installation will return a bundle id. You can issue the list command to verify that bundle is on the list. Initially it will have \nInstalled\n status.\n\n\nAs per OSGi specification, before a bundle can be started, it has to be Resolved. To resolve, issue the following command.  \n\n\nkaraf@root(bundle)\n resolve 242\n\n\n\n\nYou can start and stop the bundle as below.\n\n\nkaraf@root(bundle)\n start 242\nHello World!\nkaraf@root(bundle)\n stop 242\nGoodbye World!\nkaraf@root(bundle)\n \n\n\n\n\nKaraf - Features - Hello World\n\n\nKaraf Features allows for bundles to be grouped, managed and deployed together. Features can be nested as well. Feature files of frameworks such as Apache Camel or Apache ActiveMQ can be used to deploy those services.  \n\n\nA simple Features file is as below.  \n\n\nfeatures\n\n  \nfeature name='greeter_server' version='1.0'\n\n    \nbundle\nfile:///home/ubuntu/helloworld-1.0.0.jar\n/bundle\n\n    \nbundle\nfile:///home/ubuntu/helloworld2-1.0.0.jar\n/bundle\n\n  \n/feature\n\n\n/features\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can add the features to Karaf as below:\n\n\nkaraf@root()\n feature:repo-add file:///home/ubuntu/features.xml\n\n\n\n\nYou can install the feature's bundles as below.  \n\n\nkaraf@root(feature)\n install greeter_server\nHello World 2 !\nHello World!\n\n\n\n\nUninstalling the feature.\n\n\nkaraf@root(feature)\n uninstall greeter_server\nGoodbye World 2 !\nGoodbye World!\n\n\n\n\n\nGradle\n\n\nGradle is used by Alpaca as a build and package management tool. It is similar to \nMaven\n.  \n\n\nApache Camel\n\n\nApache Camel is an integration framework that aids in implementing integration patterns.  \n\n\nAlpaca - Apache Camel HelloWorld\n\n\nMaven has camel-archetype-blueprint which can be used to create apache-camel OSGi bundle project structure.  \n\n\nCreating a project/bundle under Alpaca\n\n\nmvn archetype:generate -DarchetypeGroupId=org.apache.camel.archetypes -DarchetypeArtifactId=camel-archetype-blueprint -DarchetypeVersion=2.9.0 -DarchetypeRepository=https://repository.apache.org/content/groups/snapshots-g\n\n\n\n\nHowever, it is easier to copy the structure of an existing project such as \nislandora-connector-broadcast\n.\n\n\ncp -R islandora-connector-broadcast/ islandora-connector-helloworld\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen the project in your IDE. In Eclipse, you can go to File | Open Projects from File System and navigate the new folder.  \n\n\nWe need to rename the configuration, java and build files to reflect the helloworld project.  \n\n\n\n\nsrc/main/cfg/ca.islandora.alpaca.connector.helloworld.cfg\n\n\nsrc/main/java/ca/islandora/alpaca/connector/helloworld\n\n\nsrc/main/java/ca/islandora/alpaca/connector/helloworld/HelloworldRouter.java\n\n\n\n\nAlso change the content of the above file to log Hello World\n\n\npackage ca.islandora.alpaca.connector.helloworld;\n\nimport static org.apache.camel.LoggingLevel.INFO;\n\nimport org.apache.camel.builder.RouteBuilder;\nimport org.slf4j.Logger;\nimport org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;\n\npublic class HelloworldRouter extends RouteBuilder {\n\n    private static final Logger LOGGER = LoggerFactory.getLogger(HelloworldRouter.class);\n\n    /**\n     * Configure the message route workflow.\n     */\n    public void configure() throws Exception {\n\n        // Hello World.\n        from(\ntimer:foo?period=5000\n).log(INFO, LOGGER, \nHello World\n);\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsrc/main/resource/OSGI-INF/blueprint/blueprint.xml\n - Change the content of this file to reflect Helloworld package.  \n\n\nsrc/build.gradle\n\n\n\n\napply plugin: 'osgi'\n\ndescription = 'Islandora CLAW HelloWorld'\n\ndependencies {\n    compile group: 'org.apache.camel', name: 'camel-core', version: camelVersion\n    compile group: 'org.apache.camel', name: 'camel-blueprint', version: camelVersion\n    compile group: 'org.apache.activemq', name: 'activemq-camel', version: activemqVersion\n    compile group: 'org.slf4j', name: 'slf4j-api', version: slf4jVersion\n    testCompile group: 'org.apache.camel', name: 'camel-test-blueprint', version: camelVersion\n}\n\njar {\n    manifest {\n        description project.description\n        docURL project.docURL\n        vendor project.vendor\n        license project.license\n\n        instruction 'Import-Package', 'org.apache.activemq.camel.component,' +\n                            \norg.apache.camel;version=\\\n${camelVersionRange}\\\n,\n +\n                            defaultOsgiImports\n        instruction 'Export-Package', 'ca.islandora.alpaca.connector.helloworld'\n    }\n}\n\nartifacts {\n    archives (file('build/cfg/main/ca.islandora.alpaca.connector.helloworld.cfg')) {\n        classifier 'configuration'\n        type 'cfg'\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nBuilding the bundle\n\n\nTo build this project, we have to update the Alpaca build settings. Include and add the project in \nAlpaca/settings.gradle\n.\n\n\ninclude ':islandora-connector-helloworld'\nproject(':islandora-connector-helloworld').projectDir = \n$rootDir/islandora-connector-helloworld\n as File\n\n\n\n\nNormally, we would also have to update the \nkaraf/src/main/resources/features.xml\n file to include this bundle. However, we will be deploying the bundle directly into Karaf's Hot deployment directory. Thus, not needed at this time.\n\n\nTo build it from command line in Linux.\n\n\nubuntu:~/workspace/Alpaca$ sudo gradle w build\n\n\n\n\nDeploying the bundle\n\n\n\n\nUpload the bundle to the Apache Karaf deploy directory: \n/opt/apache-karaf-4.0.5/deploy\n\n\nLogin to Karaf. You can also use the Karaf client here: \n/opt/karaf/bin/client\n.\n\n\n\n\nssh -p 8101 karaf@localhost\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVerify that bundle is deployed\n\n\n\n\nbundle:list\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee the log to confirm that the bundle is working.\n\n\n\n\nlog:tail\n\n\n\n\nYou should see a message like below:\n\n\n2017-02-24 21:30:17,973 | INFO  | 12 - timer://foo | HelloworldRouter                 | 186 - ca.islandora.alpaca.islandora-connector-helloworld - 0.2.1.SNAPSHOT | Hello World\n\n\n\n\nApache ActiveMQ\n\n\nApache ActiveMQ is a JMS compliant Messaging Queue. Messaging client can make use of JMS to send messages.\n\n\nInstalling ActiveMQ\n\n\nInstalling ActiveMQ is relatively easy. Download the latest stable release \nhere\n. Go to the \nactivemq_install_dir/bin\n. Start the ActiveMQ by using the activemq script or batch file and start command.\n\n\n$ cd activemq_install_dir/bin\n$ ./activemq start\n\n\n\n\nWhen ActiveMQ gets started, go to http://localhost:8161/admin/. You can login using admin:admin.\n\n\nNote that ActiveMQ in CLAW vagrant does not have a UI.  \n\n\nReferences\n\n\n\n\nOSGI for Beginners\n\n\nPlaying with Apache Karaf Console\n\n\nKaraf Quick Start\n\n\nActiveMQ Introduction",

All contributions are welcome: use-cases, documentation, code, patches, bug reports, feature requests, etc. You do not need to be a programmer to speak up!\n\n\nWorkflows\n\n\nThe group meets each Wednesday at 1:00 PM Eastern. Meeting notes and announcements are posted to the \nIslandora community list\n and the \nIslandora developers list\n. You can view meeting agendas, notes, and call-in information \nhere\n. Anybody is welcome to join the calls, and add items to the agenda.\n\n\nUse cases\n\n\nIf you would like to submit a use case to the Islandora CLAW project, please submit an issue \nhere\n using the \nUse Case template\n, prepending \"Use Case:\" to the title of the issue.\n\n\nDocumentation\n\n\nYou can contribute documentation in two different ways. One way is to create an issue \nhere\n, prepending \"Documentation:\" to the title of the issue. Another way is by pull request, which is the same process as \nContribute Code\n. All documentation resides in \ndocs\n.\n\n\nRequest a new feature\n\n\nTo request a new feature you should \nopen an issue in the CLAW repository\n or create a use case (see the \nUse cases\n section above), and summarize the desired functionality. Prepend \"Enhancement:\" if creating an issue on the project repo, and \"Use Case:\" if creating a use case.\n\n\nReport a bug\n\n\nTo report a bug you should \nopen an issue in the CLAW repository\n that summarizes the bug. Prepend the label \"Bug:\" to the title of the issue.\n\n\nIn order to help us understand and fix the bug it would be great if you could provide us with:\n\n\n\n\nThe steps to reproduce the bug. This includes information about e.g. the Islandora version you were using along with the versions of stack components.\n\n\nThe expected behavior.\n\n\nThe actual, incorrect behavior.\n\n\n\n\nFeel free to search the issue queue for existing issues (aka tickets) that already describe the problem; if there is such a ticket please add your information as a comment.\n\n\nIf you want to provide a pull along with your bug report:\n\n\nThat is great! In this case please send us a pull request as described in the section \nCreate a pull request\n  below.\n\n\nContribute code\n\n\nBefore you set out to contribute code you will need to have completed a \nContributor License Agreement\n or be covered by a \nCorporate Contributor Licencse Agreement\n. The signed copy of the license agreement should be sent to \n\n\nIf you are interested in contributing code to Islandora but do not know where to begin:\n\n\nIn this case you should \nbrowse open issues\n and check out \nuse cases\n.\n\n\nIf you are contributing Drupal code, it must adhere to \nDrupal Coding Standards\n; Travis CI will check for this on pull requests.\n\n\nContributions to the Islandora codebase should be sent as GitHub pull requests. See section \nCreate a pull request\n below for details.

If you ever ruin your environment (trust me, it\u2019ll happen), you can always destroy it and bring up a new one at any time.\n\n\n~ $ cd /path/to/CLAW/install\n/path/to/CLAW/install $ vagrant destroy\n/path/to/CLAW/install $ vagrant up\n\n\n\n\nLogging in to your development environment\n\n\nYou can ssh into your development environment at any time by doing the following:\n\n\n~ $ cd /path/to/islandora/install\n/path/to/islandora/install $ vagrant ssh\nWelcome to Ubuntu 14.04.2 LTS (GNU/Linux 3.13.0-45-generic x86_64)\n\n * Documentation:  https://help.ubuntu.com/\n\n System information disabled due to load higher than 1.0\n\n  Get cloud support with Ubuntu Advantage Cloud Guest:\n    http://www.ubuntu.com/business/services/cloud\n\n\nLast login: Fri Jul 17 13:51:38 2015 from 10.0.2.2\nvagrant@islandora:~$\n\n\n\n\nYou'll be logged in as the vagrant user, with your github repo in your home directory.\n\n\nPort Forwarding\n\n\nMany ports are forwarded from your virtual machine to your personal computer, so care must be taken that there are no conflicts. Here's a list of all the ports that get forwarded:\n- Apache: 80 -\n 8000\n- Tomcat: 8080 -\n 8080\n- Karaf: 8181 -\n 8181\n- MySQL: 3306 -\n 3306\n\n\nAt any point in time, you can edit how the ports are forwarded by clicking on the Port Forwarding button in your virtual machine's Network settings in Virtualbox.\n\n\nYou can also edit the section of the Vagrantfile that controls the default port forwarding, which looks something like this:\n\n\n  config.vm.network :forwarded_port, guest: 8080, host: 8080 # Tomcat\n  config.vm.network :forwarded_port, guest: 8181, host: 8181 # Karaf\n  config.vm.network :forwarded_port, guest: 3306, host: 3306 # MySQL\n  config.vm.network :forwarded_port, guest: 5432, host: 5432 # PostgreSQL\n  config.vm.network :forwarded_port, guest: 80, host: 8000 # Apache\n\n\n\n\nImportant locations\n\n\n\n\nDrupal: \n/var/www/html/drupal\n\n\nApache Logs: \n/var/log/apache2/error.log\n\n\nTomcat: \n/var/lib/tomcat7\n\n\nLogs: \n/var/log/tomcat7\n\n\nFedora 4: \n/var/lib/tomcat7/webapps/fcrepo\n\n\nSolr: \n/var/lib/tomcat7/webapps/solr\n\n\nBlazeGraph: \n/var/lib/tomcat7/webapps/bigdata\n\n\nFcrepoCamelToolbox: \n/var/lib/tomcat7/webapps/fcrepo-camel-toolbox\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKaraf: \n/opt/karaf\n\n\nLogs: \n/opt/karaf/data/log\n\n\nConfiguration: \n/opt/karaf/etc\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCLAW: \n/home/vagrant/CLAW\n\n\n\n\nShared folders\n\n\nBy default, the vagrant environment uses a shared folder between your computer and the virtual machine it has created. This folder points to your Islandora CLAW github repo on your computer and is available at \n~/CLAW\n (\n/home/vagrant/CLAW\n) on the virtual machine. On top of that, in Drupal, \nsites/all/modules/islandora\n is a symlink pointing to \n~/CLAW/islandora\n.  This has a few profound consequences:\n\n\n\n\nYou can use the IDE you're comfortable with on your own machine, without the need to scp/rsync code over to the development environment\n\n\nChanges to Drupal module code are automatically reflected on your Drupal site since that code is symlinked (although you may need to be ssh'd in to \ndrush cc all\n on occassion)\n\n\nWhen testing the Vagrant install after adding changes, the code from your fork and your branch on your computer is used to generate the virtual machine\n\n\n\n\nCompiling Camel Bundles\n\n\nDespite being nothing but Blueprint xml files, Camel projects still have to be compiled using Maven. The \ninstall\n directive is the default, so all one has to do is navigate to the appropriate directory and issue a \nmvn\n in the command line.  For example, to compile the collection service:\n\n\n~ $ cd /path/to/CLAW/Alpaca/services/collection-service\n/path/to/CLAW/Alpaca/serices/collection-service $ mvn\n\n\n\n\nThe only caveat here is that this is best done on the virtual machine itself. While your virtual machine was being built, it's Karaf installation was set to monitor the vagrant user's Maven repository for changes, and autodeploy in response to \nmvn install\n. So while you can always run Maven from your own machine, it will get installed in your personal Maven repository on your machine. So to take advantage of the auto-redeploy capabilities of Karaf, you need to do this as the vagrant user.\n\n\nIf for any reason, you have to shutdown or restart Karaf, it will cease to monitor the vagrant user's Maven repository. In order to turn this back on, you'll have to issue the appropriate commands to get monitoring working again. The easiest way to do this is to re-run the karaf script the install process uses to set up monitoring by executing \n/opt/karaf/bin/client \n ~/islandora/install/karaf/monitor.script\n.",

If you ever ruin your environment (trust me, it\u2019ll happen), you can always destroy it and bring up a new one at any time.  ~ $ cd /path/to/CLAW/install\n/path/to/CLAW/install $ vagrant destroy\n/path/to/CLAW/install $ vagrant up",

You can also edit the section of the Vagrantfile that controls the default port forwarding, which looks something like this:    config.vm.network :forwarded_port, guest: 8080, host: 8080 # Tomcat\n  config.vm.network :forwarded_port, guest: 8181, host: 8181 # Karaf\n  config.vm.network :forwarded_port, guest: 3306, host: 3306 # MySQL\n  config.vm.network :forwarded_port, guest: 5432, host: 5432 # PostgreSQL\n  config.vm.network :forwarded_port, guest: 80, host: 8000 # Apache",

On top of that, in Drupal,  sites/all/modules/islandora  is a symlink pointing to  ~/CLAW/islandora .  This has a few profound consequences:   You can use the IDE you're comfortable with on your own machine, without the need to scp/rsync code over to the development environment  Changes to Drupal module code are automatically reflected on your Drupal site since that code is symlinked (although you may need to be ssh'd in to  drush cc all  on occassion)  When testing the Vagrant install after adding changes, the code from your fork and your branch on your computer is used to generate the virtual machine",

The  install  directive is the default, so all one has to do is navigate to the appropriate directory and issue a  mvn  in the command line.  For example, to compile the collection service:  ~ $ cd /path/to/CLAW/Alpaca/services/collection-service\n/path/to/CLAW/Alpaca/serices/collection-service $ mvn  The only caveat here is that this is best done on the virtual machine itself. While your virtual machine was being built, it's Karaf installation was set to monitor the vagrant user's Maven repository for changes, and autodeploy in response to  mvn install . So while you can always run Maven from your own machine, it will get installed in your personal Maven repository on your machine. So to take advantage of the auto-redeploy capabilities of Karaf, you need to do this as the vagrant user.  If for any reason, you have to shutdown or restart Karaf, it will cease to monitor the vagrant user's Maven repository. In order to turn this back on, you'll have to issue the appropriate commands to get monitoring working again. The easiest way to do this is to re-run the karaf script the install process uses to set up monitoring by executing  /opt/karaf/bin/client   ~/islandora/install/karaf/monitor.script .",
